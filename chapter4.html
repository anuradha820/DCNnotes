  oThe Network Layer is the third layer of the OSI model.
  o It handles the service requests from the transport layer and further forwards the service
    request to the data link layer.<br>
  o The network layer translates the logical addresses into physical addresses<br>
  o It determines the route from the source to the destination and also manages the traffic
    problems such as switching, routing and controls the congestion of data packets.<br>
  o The main role of the network layer is to move the packets from sending host to the
    receiving host.<br>
              </ol>
            
            <h2><center>The main functions performed by the network layer are:</center></h2>
            <li>
              <ol>
            
 o Routing: When a packet reaches the router's input link, the router will move the packets
   to the router's output link. For example,<br> a packet from S1 to R1 must be forwarded to
   the next router on the path to S2.<br>
 o Logical Addressing: The data link layer implements the physical addressing and network
   layer implements the logical addressing.<br> Logical addressing is also used to distinguish
   between source and destination system. The network layer adds a header to the packet<br>
   which includes the logical addresses of both the sender and the receiver.<br>
 o Internetworking : This is the main role of the network layer that it provides the logical
   connection between different types of networks.<br>
 o Fragmentation: The fragmentation is a process of breaking the packets into the smallest
   individual data units that travel through different networks.<br>
   </ol>

            
            <h3><center> Network Layer Design Issues :</center></h3>
            <p>
                The network layer comes with some design issues that are described as follows:<br>
  1. Store and Forward packet switching<br>
     The host sends the packet to the nearest router. This packet is stored there until it has fully
     arrived once the <br>link is fully processed by verifying the checksum then it is forwarded to the
     next router till it reaches the destination. This mechanism is called <br>“Store and Forward packet
     switching.”<br>
  2. Services provided to the Transport Layer<br>
     Through the network/transport layer interface, the network layer transfers its patterns services<br>
     to the transport layer. These services are described below. But before providing these services
     to the transfer layer,<br>
     
The following goals must be kept in mind:-<br>

       Offering services must not depend on router technology.<br>
       The transport layer needs to be protected from the type, number, and topology of the
        available router.<br>
       The network addresses for the transport layer should use uniform numbering
        patterns, also at LAN and WAN connections.<br>
        Based on the connections there are 2 types of services provided :<br>
       Connectionless – The routing and insertion of packets into the subnet are done
        individually. No added setup is required.<br>
       Connection-Oriented – Subnet must offer reliable service and all the packets must be
        transmitted over a single route.<br>

            </p>
            <h4>3. Implementation of Connectionless Service</h4>
            <p>
                Packets are termed as “datagram’s” and corresponding subnets as “datagram subnets”. When
the message size that has to be<br> transmitted is 4 times the size of the packet, then the network
layer divides into 4 packets and transmits each packet to the router via. a few protocols.<br> Each
data packet has a destination address and is routed independently irrespective of the packets.
            </p>
            <h5>4. Implementation of Connection-Oriented service:</h5>
            <p>
 To use a connection-oriented service, first, we establish a connection, use it, and then release
it. In connection-oriented services, the data packets are delivered to the receiver<br> in the same
order in which they have been sent by the sender. It can be done in either two ways :<br>

   Circuit Switched Connection – A dedicated physical path or a circuit is established
    between the communicating nodes and then the data stream is transferred.<br>
   Virtual Circuit Switched Connection – The data stream is transferred over a packet
    switched network, in such a way that it seems to the user that there is a dedicated<br> path
    from the sender to the receiver. A virtual path is established here.<br> While, other
    connections may also be using the same path.<br>
            </p>
            <h2><center>Routing algorithms</center></h2>
            <p>
       Routing algorithms : are software programs that implement different
        routing protocols.<br>
        They work by assigning a cost number to each link;<br>
        The cost number is calculated using various network metrics.<br>
        Every router tries to forward the data packet to the next best link with
         the lowest cost.<br>
            </p>
                  Adaptive routing algorithms, also known as dynamic routing algorithms,
                  makes routing decisions dynamically depending on the network conditions.<br>
                   It constructs the routing table depending upon the network traffic
                   and topology.<br>They try to compute the optimized route depending upon the
                    hop count, transit time and distance.<br>
            Non-adaptive Routing algorithms, also known as static routing algorithms,
            construct a static routing table to determine the path through which packets
            are to be sent.<br> The static routing table is constructed based upon the routing
            information stored in the routers when the network is booted up.<br>
           Hybrid Algorithms As the name suggests, these algorithms are a
           combination of both adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms.<br> In this approach,
           the network is divided into several regions, and each region uses a different
           algorithm<br>

           <h3>Flooding Algorithm:</h3>
           <p>
               Flooding is a non-adaptive routing technique following this simple method:<br>
               when a data packet arrives at a router, it is sent to all the outgoing links except the
                one it has arrived on.<br>
               All possible routes between Source and Destination are tried. A packet will always
                get through if the path exists<br>
               As all routes are tried, there will be at least one route which is the shortest<br>
               All nodes directly or indirectly connected are visited<br>
Using flooding technique −<br>
    An incoming packet to A,
     will be sent to B, C and D.<br>
    B will send the packet to C and E.<br>
    C will send the packet to B, D and F.<br>
    D will send the packet to C and F.<br>
    E will send the packet to F.<br>
    F will send the packet to C and E.<br>
          <h3>Types of Flooding</h3>
        <p>
            Uncontrolled flooding − <br>
             here, each router unconditionally transmits the
             incoming data packets to all its neighbours.<br>
            Controlled flooding −<br> They use some methods to control the transmission of
             packets to the neighbouring nodes.<br> The two popular algorithms for controlled
             flooding are Sequence Number Controlled Flooding (SNCF) and Reverse Path
             Forwarding (RPF).<br>
            Selective flooding − Here, the routers don't transmit the incoming packets only
             along those paths which are heading towards approximately in the right
            direction, instead of every available paths.<br>
    Advantages of Flooding :<br>
        Highly Robust, emergency or immediate messages can be sent (eg military
         applications)<br>
    
        Set up the route in virtual circuit<br>
        Flooding always chooses the shortest path<br>
        Broadcast messages to all the nodes<br>
      Disadvantages of Flooding :<br>
           Network congestion:<br>
           Wastage of network resources:<br>
           Security risks:<br>
           Inefficient use of energy:<br>
          <h3>Distance Vector Routing (DVR)</h3>
          <p>
            Distance Vector Routing (DVR)<br>
             Distance Vector Routing (DVR) Protocol is a method used by routers to find the best path for
              data to travel across a network.<br>
             Each router keeps a table that shows the shortest distance to every other router, based on
              the number of hops (or steps) needed to reach them.<br>
             Routers share this information with their neighbors, allowing them to update their tables
              and find the most efficient routes.<br>
             This protocol helps ensure that data moves quickly and smoothly through the network.<br>
             Historically known as the old ARPANET routing algorithm (or known as the Bellman-Ford
              algorithm).<br>

Example :<br>
Consider 3-routers X, Y and Z as shown in figure. Each router have their routing table. Every
routing table will contain distance to the destination nodes.<br>
X will share it routing table to neighbors and
neighbors will share it routing table to it to X
and distance from node X to destination will be
calculated using bellmen- ford equation.<br>
As we can see that distance will be
less going from X to Z when Y is intermediate
node(hop) so it will be update in routing table X.<br>
Similarly for Z also

<h3>Applications of Distance Vector Routing Algorithm</h3>
<br>
<p>The Distance Vector Routing Algorithm has several uses:<br>
 Computer Networking: It helps route data packets in networks.<br>
 Telephone Systems: It’s used in some telephone switching systems.<br>
 Military Applications: It has been used to route missiles.<br>

</p>
<h3>Advantages of Distance Vector routing</h3>
<br>
<p>
   Shortest Path: Distance Vector Routing finds the shortest path for data to travel in a
    network.<br>
   Usage: It is used in local, metropolitan, and wide-area networks.<br>
   Easy Implementation: The method is simple to set up and doesn’t require many
    resources.<br>

          </p>
          <h3>Disadvantages of Distance Vector Routing Algorithm</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
             It is slower to converge than link state.<br>
             It is at risk from the count-to-infinity problem.<br>
             It creates more traffic than link state since a hop count change must be propagated to all
              routers and processed on each router.<br> Hop count updates take place on a periodic basis,
              even if there are no changes in the network topology, so bandwidth-wasting broadcasts
              still occur.<br>


          </p>
          <h3>Hierarchical routing</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
             Hierarchical routing protocols consist of a hierarchical topology to organize the network and
              routing information.<br>
             Multiple layers and levels are introduced in a network. Each layer may be assigned a
              different responsibility like forwarding packets, maintaining routing tables, etc.<br>
             HRPs are valuable for large networks, as they provide the capability of organizing network
              information and reducing the amount of routing information that should be exchanged
              between nodes.<br>
             Hence, HRPs demonstrate significant scalability and fault tolerance.<br>
             This is attributed to their hierarchical structure, which provides redundancy and facilitates
              the efficient distribution of routing data throughout the network<br>


          </p>
          
            
            <p>
              Explanation<br>
         Step 1 − For example, the best path from 1A to 5C is via region 2, but hierarchical
                routing of all traffic to region 5 goes via region 3 as it is better for most of the other destinations
                of region 5.<br>
        Step 2 − Consider a subnet of 720 routers. If no hierarchy is used, each router will have
               720 entries in its routing table.<br>
        Step 3 − Now if the subnet is partitioned into 24 regions of 30 routers each, then each
                router will require 30 local entries and 23 remote entries for a total of 53 entries.<br>


        </p>
        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
           Reduction in Table Size: HSR protocol reduces the routing table size by making use of
            hierarchy information.<br> The storage space required is of O(N x M) whereas in flat
            topology the space required is O(NM). Here, N is the average number of nodes in a
            cluster and m is the number of levels.<br>


        </p>
        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
           Overhead Involved: The overhead for exchanging packets containing information about
            multiple levels of hierarchy and cluster head appointment process makes the protocol
            expensive from the ad hoc wireless network point of view.<br>
           Scalability: The number of nodes involved in an ad hoc network does not grow to the
           dimensions of the number of nodes in the Internet which is more suited for hierarchical
           routing.<br>
           Time Consuming: Sharing information across all levels of the hierarchy and conducting
           leader elections within each cluster is a time-consuming process.<br>


        </p>
        <h3>Link state routing</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Link state routing is a technique in which each router shares the knowledge of its
          neighborhood with every other router i.e. the internet work.<br> The three keys to understand the
          link state routing algorithm.<br>
        o The Link state routing algorithm is also known as Dijkstra's algorithm which is used to find
          the shortest path from one node to every other node in the network.<br>
        o The Dijkstra's algorithm is an iterative, and it has the property that after kth iteration of the
          algorithm, the least cost paths are well known for k destination nodes.<br>


        </p> 
        <h3>Link State Routing has two phases:</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
          Reliable Flooding<br>
       o Initial state: Each node knows the cost of its neighbors.<br>
       o Final state: Each node knows the entire graph.<br>
