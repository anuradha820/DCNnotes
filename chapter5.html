            <h2>TRANSPORT AND APPLICATION LAYER</h2>
            <p>
                The transport layer is the fourth layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)<br>
                model, and it plays a crucial role in managing end-to-end communication between
                devices on a network.<br> 


            </p>
            
                <p>


                The transport layer receives data (message) from the Application layer and then
                performs Segmentation, divides the actual message into segments,<br> adds the source
                and destination’s port numbers into the header of the segment, and transfers the
                message to the Network layer. (At the sender’s side: )<br>


                </p>
                <P>


                    The transport layer receives data from the Network layer, reassembles the segmented
                    data, reads its header, identifies the port number,<br> and forwards the message to the
                    appropriate port in the Application layer. (At the receiver’s side: )<br>


                </P>
                <h2>Elements of transport service</h2>
                <p>
                    The transport layer also determines the type of service provided to the users from
                   the session layer.<br> An error-free point-to-point communication to deliver messages in the
                   order in which they were transmitted is one of the key functions of the transport layer.<br>

                   </p>
                   <h3>1)Protocols:</h3>
                   <p>
                     Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): Provides reliable, connection-oriented
                      communication with error recovery, flow control, and data
                    segmentation/reassembly.<br> It guarantees that data packets are delivered
                    accurately and in the correct order.<br>
                    User Datagram Protocol (UDP): Offers connectionless, faster communication
                     without built-in reliability or flow control.<br> It is used when speed is critical and
                     occasional data loss is acceptable, such as in real-time applications like video
                     streaming and online gaming.<br>


                   </p>
                  <h3>2) Port Numbers:</h3>
                  <p>
                     Port Numbers: Used to distinguish different services or applications on a single
                      device.<br> For example, HTTP traffic typically uses port 80, while HTTPS uses port
                      443.<br> Port numbers ensure that data is directed to the correct application or
                      service.<br>


                  </p>
                  <h3>3) Connection Establishment and Termination:</h3> 
                  <p>
                     Connection Establishment: In connection-oriented protocols like TCP,<br>
                     establishing a connection involves a handshake process to set up parameters
                     and ensure both parties are ready for communication.<br>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     Connection Termination: Properly closing a connection involves a handshake<br> or
                     teardown process to ensure that all data is transmitted and resources are
                    released.<br>


                  </p>
                  <h3>4) Error Detection and Correction:</h3>
                  <p>
                     Checksums and Acknowledgements: Protocols like TCP use checksums to
                      detect errors<br> in transmitted data and acknowledgements to confirm receipt of
                      data.<br> Retransmission of lost or corrupted packets ensures data integrity.<br>

                  </p>
                  <h3>5) Flow Control:</h3>
                  <p>
                     Flow Control Mechanisms: Manage the rate of data transmission between sender<br>
                     and receiver to prevent overwhelming the receiver or network congestion.<br> TCP
                     uses mechanisms like window sizing to control data flow.<br>


                  </p>
                  <h3>6)Segmentation and Reassembly:</h3>
                  <p>
                     Segmentation: Large messages are divided into smaller segments or packets for
                      transmission over the network.<br> Each segment is transmitted separately and
                      reassembled at the destination.<br>
                     Reassembly: At the receiving end, segments are reassembled into the original
                     message in the correct order.<br>


                  </p>
                  <h3>7) Quality of Service (QoS):</h3>
                  <p>
                     QoS Mechanisms: Manage network resources to ensure that critical applications
                      receive the necessary bandwidth, latency, and priority.<br> QoS settings help
                      prioritize traffic and improve the performance of applications requiring high
                      reliability or low latency.<br>



                  </p>
                  <h3>Elements Of Transport Protocols</h3>
                  <p>
                     Transport protocols are crucial in networking as they manage the end-to-end
                      communication between systems.<br> The primary elements of transport protocols, such as
                      TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), include:<br>



                  </p>
                  <h2>1. Connection Establishment</h2>
                  <p>
                      TCP: Uses a handshake process to establish a connection between the sender
                       and receiver before data transfer begins.<br> This process ensures that both parties
                       are synchronized and ready to communicate.<br>
                      UDP: Connectionless, meaning it does not establish a connection before sending
                       data.<br> It sends packets without ensuring the receiver is ready or has
                       acknowledged receipt.<br>


                  </p>
                  <h2>2. Data Segmentation and Reassembly</h2>
                  <p>
                      Segmentation: Large data messages are broken down into smaller packets or
                       segments for transmission.<br> This is necessary for efficient data handling and
                       network management.<br>
                      Reassembly: At the destination, these segments are reassembled into the
                       original message.<br> TCP handles this process to ensure data is reconstructed in
                       the correct order.<br>


                  </p>
                  <h2>3. Error Detection and Correction</h2>
                  <p>
                     Checksums: Both TCP and UDP use checksums to detect errors in transmitted
                      data.<br> The sender calculates a checksum value for the data, and the receiver
                      verifies it to detect any corruption.<br>
                     Acknowledgements (TCP): TCP provides acknowledgements (ACKs) to confirm
                      receipt of data packets.<br> If a packet is lost or corrupted, TCP retransmits it based
                      on the lack of acknowledgment.<br>


                  </p>
                  <h2>4. Flow Control</h2>
                  <p>
                      TCP Flow Control: Manages the rate of data transmission between sender and
                       receiver to prevent overwhelming the receiver or causing network congestion.<br> It
                      uses a sliding window mechanism to control the amount of data that can be sent
                      before receiving an acknowledgment.<br>


                  </p>
                  <h2>5. Congestion Control</h2>
                  <p>
                      TCP Congestion Control: Monitors network traffic and adjusts the rate of data
                       transmission to avoid network congestion.<br> It uses algorithms like slow start,
                       congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, and fast recovery to dynamically manage
                       traffic flow.<br>


                  </p>
                  <h2>6. Data Ordering</h2>
                  <p>
                      TCP: Ensures data packets are delivered in the correct order.<br> Sequence
                       numbers are used to reassemble packets in the proper sequence at the
                       destination.<br>
                      UDP: Does not guarantee the order of packet delivery.<br> Packets may arrive out of
                       sequence, and it is up to the application layer to handle any necessary ordering<br>


                  </p>
                  <h2>7. Connection Termination</h2>
                  <p>
                      TCP: Handles the orderly termination of connections using a four-way handshake<br>
                       to ensure that all data is transmitted and acknowledged before closing the
                       connection.<br>
                      UDP: No formal termination process since it is connectionless.<br> The protocol does
                       not maintain state information about connections.<br>


                  </p>
                  <h2>Internet Transport Protocols</h2>
                  <p>
                     A transport protocol is a set of rules and procedures responsible for delivering data<br>
                      between application processes running on different hosts in a network.<br> It enables
                      communication by providing services such as data integrity, congestion avoidance, and
                      flow control.<br>



                  </p>
                  <h2>1. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP):</h2>
                  <p>
                       Connection-Oriented: TCP establishes a connection between the sender and receiver
                        before transmitting data, ensuring a reliable and ordered communication channel.<br>
                       Reliable Delivery: Guarantees that data is delivered correctly and in the same order it
                        was sent.<br> It handles retransmission of lost or corrupted packets and manages data
                        integrity.<br>
                    Key Features:<br>
                     Three-Way Handshake: Establishes a connection through a three-step process (SYN,
                      SYN-ACK, ACK).<br>
                     Flow Control: Uses windowing mechanisms to control the rate of data transmission,
                      preventing the receiver from being overwhelmed<br>.
                     Error Detection and Correction: Employs checksums to detect errors and
                      acknowledgements to confirm receipt. Lost packets are retransmitted.<br>
                     Congestion Control: Adjusts data transmission rates based on network traffic conditions
                      to avoid congestion.<br>
                     Data Segmentation and Reassembly: Breaks large messages into smaller packets for
                      transmission and reassembles them at the destination.<br>
                  Use Cases:<br>
                     Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)<br>
                     Email (SMTP, POP3, IMAP)<br>
                     File transfer (FTP)<br>
                     Secure communications (SSL/TLS)<br>


                  </p>
                  <h2>2. User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</h2>
                  <p>
                      Overview:<br>
                      Connectionless: UDP does not establish a connection before data transmission.<br> It sends
                       data as discrete packets (datagrams) without guaranteeing delivery or order.<br>
                      Fast and Lightweight: Because it lacks connection establishment, flow control,<br> and error
                       recovery mechanisms, UDP offers lower latency and overhead compared to TCP.<br>
                   Key Features:<br>
                 No Handshake: Data is sent without prior setup, reducing latency.<br>
                 Best-Effort Delivery: Provides no guarantee that packets arrive, are in order, or are free
                  from errors.<br> The application must handle errors and packet loss if needed.<br>
                 Simple Error Checking: Uses checksums for error detection but does not include
                  mechanisms for error correction or retransmission.<br>
                 No Flow Control or Congestion Control: UDP does not manage data flow or adjust
                  transmission rates based on network conditions.<br>
               Use Cases:<br>
            Streaming media (video/audio)<br>
            Online gaming<br>
            VoIP (Voice over IP)<br>
            DNS (Domain Name System) queries<br>


                  </p>
                  <h2>APPLICATION LAYER</h2>
                  <p>
                      The application layer sits at Layer 7, the top of the Open Systems Interconnection               
                       (OSI) communications model.<br>
                      It ensures an application can effectively communicate with other applications on
                       different computer systems and networks.<br>
                      The application layer is not an application.<br>
                      Instead, it is a component within an application that controls the communication
                       method to other devices.<br>
                      It is an abstraction layer service that masks the rest of the application from the
                      transmission process.<br>


                  </p>
                  <h2>DOMAIN NAME SYSYTEM(DNS)</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Domain Name System (DNS) is like the internet’s phone book.<br>
                        It helps you find websites by translating easy-to-remember names (like
                         www.example.com)<br> into the numerical IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1) that
                         computers use to locate each other on the internet.<br>
                        Domain Name System (DNS) is a hostname used for IP address translation
                         services.<br>
                        DNS is a distributed database implemented in a hierarchy of name servers.<br> It is
                         an application layer protocol for message exchange between clients and servers.<br>
                        It is required for the functioning of the Internet.<br>


                    </p>
                    <h1>Types of Domain</h1>
                    <p>
                       There are various kinds of domains:<br>
                      Generic Domains: .com(commercial), .edu(educational), .mil(military),
                      .org(nonprofit organization),<br> .net(similar to commercial) all these are generic
                       domains.<br>
                      Country Domain: .in (India) .us .uk<br>
                      Inverse Domain: if we want to know what is the domain name of the website. <br>IP
                       to domain name mapping. So DNS can provide both the mapping for example to
                       find the IP addresses of geeksforgeeks.org then we have to type<br>



                    </p>
                    <h2>WORKING OF DNS</h2>
                    <p>
                      1. The client software initiates a DNS resolution (in response to a request by another
                          software running on the computer) to access another computer using its name.<br>
                          Configuring a resolver is easy and all that it requires is the IP address of a recursive
                          server.<br>
                        2. The recursive server receives DNS queries from the resolvers and is responsible for
                           executing all the resolution steps needed to provide the final answer to the client
                           (resolver).<br> Recursive servers query multiple servers until they obtain the answer to
                           the query.<br>
                        3. Finally, the authoritative server has authority over a given domain name. In other
                           words, it is the trusted source of information for the domain name.<br> It contains the
                           information on which IP addresses are associated with the computers using the
                           domain name in question.<br>
                        4. A domain name resolution is initiated by the client software, which sends the query
                           to a recursive server.<br> This other server generally initiates the resolution by querying
                           the root servers, which are responsible for the highest level of the domain name
                           hierarchy.<br>
                        5. Based on the information received from the root servers, the recursive server<br>
                          queries other servers until it reaches the server responsible for the desired domain name.<br>
